    "body": "History: Established in 2018, KUCMC emerged from the collective vision of enthusiastic and visionary students within our department. Recognizing the need for a dedicated space, these students worked tirelessly to gain recognition from the university administration and support from faculty members. Their efforts paid off, and KUCMC officially became a recognized club, providing students with opportunities to engage in diverse academic and extracurricular activities. Since its inception, KUCMC has experienced exponential growth, attracting students from diverse backgrounds who share a common passion for their respective disciplines. Leadership Transition: Every year, KUCMC conducts elections to select a new board entrusted with leading and guiding the club forward. The election process is democratic, allowing interested individuals to nominate themselves for positions such as President, Vice President, General Secretary, Club Secretary, Technical Lead, Treasurer, and other executive roles outlined in the club’s constitution. Candidates present their visions, plans, and qualifications, ensuring active student participation in shaping the club’s future and a smooth leadership transition. In addition to annual elections, KUCMC conducts interviews as part of its selection process for specific club positions. Our Philosophy: KUCMC, established in 2018, aims to foster unity and provide a platform for students in Nepal to explore their academic interests and passions. Through a diverse array of events, workshops, and seminars, KUCMC has played a pivotal role in nurturing the academic and personal growth of its members. Today, KUCMC stands as a testament to the vision and dedication of its founding members, continuing to make a significant impact on the student community at Kathmandu University in Nepal. We are more than just a club; we are a community dedicated to empowering students on their academic journey.  Contact KUCMC → "
